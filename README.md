Project Title: To-Do List Application with Customizable Labels
Project Overview
This project is designed to evaluate your skills in software architecture, development, and
user interface design. You will create a web-based to-do list application that allows users to
organize tasks effectively using custom labels.
Core Features
1. Task Management:
○ Add new tasks to the to-do list.
○ Mark tasks as complete.
○ Edit or delete existing tasks.
○ Each task in the to-do list could have a label (eg - Urgent, work, personal etc)
2. Label System:
○ The system must allow creation of labels that will appear on the task (e.g.,
"Urgent," "Work," "Personal," "Low Priority").
○ Each task can have multiple labels and users must be able to create custom
labels.
○ While adding the label to a task, the system must allow users to search and
add filter and view tasks by their associated labels.

3. Label Search:
○ While adding a label to the task, the system must allow to search for a label
or create a new label
Bonus Features (Extra Credit)
● Enhanced UI/UX: Utilize modern UI libraries like Shadcn or Soft UI for a visually
appealing and user-friendly interface.
● TypeScript: Implement the application using TypeScript for improved code structure,
maintainability, and type safety.
● Clean Code Practices: Adhere to best practices for clean, readable, and
well-organized code.
● Intuitive UX Design: Go beyond the basic requirements to make the user
experience as seamless and intuitive as possible.
Technical Considerations
● Data Storage: You have flexibility in choosing a data storage solution. Options
include:
○ Local storage (for simple persistence)
○ In-memory storage (Redis is a good choice)
○ Database (your preference – consider factors like scalability and data
relationships)

Deliverables

1. Code Repository: Upload your complete source code to a public Git repository (e.g.,
GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. Deployed Application: Deploy the working application on a platform like Netlify or
Vercel.
3. Testing Instructions: Provide clear and concise instructions on how to set up and
test the application locally or on the deployed version.
4. Screencast: Record a short video demonstrating the application's core features and
any extra features you've implemented.
Evaluation Criteria
Your project will be evaluated based on the following:
● Functionality: Does the application meet all the core feature requirements? Are any
bonus features implemented?
● Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable? Are coding
best practices followed?
● UI/UX Design: Is the user interface visually appealing and easy to use? Is the user
experience intuitive?
● Innovation: Did you go beyond the basic requirements to add unique or creative
features?
● Overall Presentation: How well do you communicate your project, its features, and
your thought process?
Important Note:
Feel free to ask clarifying questions if you need additional information or guidance. Be
creative and have fun building your to-do list application!
